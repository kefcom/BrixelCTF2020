In this challenge you get a .swf file (adobe flash). You can either decompile it, or since we are looking for a string, you could unzip it, and use a find in files function to search for brixelCTF{
You will find the flag in file 6.59: Goodbye flash old friend, you gave me loads of entertainment. The flag is brixelCTF{n0_m0r3_5upp0rt}
