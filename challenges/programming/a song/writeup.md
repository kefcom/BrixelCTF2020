##### The problem:
&nbsp;
>I wrote this song
it seems I'm pretty bad at it, but hey! it could get you a flag :)

&nbsp;
##### The solution:
&nbsp;
This (badly written) songtext is actually rockstar code.
You can compile it using an online editor like https://codewithrockstar.com/online
When you copy-paste the songtext into the editor and press the rock! button, it will output this:

>brixelCTF{
5
66
7236
34
66
14
}
