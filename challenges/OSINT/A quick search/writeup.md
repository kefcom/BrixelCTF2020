##### The problem:
&nbsp;
>Here's an easy one to start off the OSINT challenges.
I took this photo but forgot the name of this tower.
Can you give me the name?
I remember it started with an E.
This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{fl-ag} format

##### The solution:
&nbsp;
Here you get an image that is reverse searchable. So you go to image.google.com and press the camera image in the search bar.
Upload the image and you will get the result: Eben-Ezer Tower.

**accepted flags = Eben-Ezer / brixelCTF{Eben-Ezer}**
