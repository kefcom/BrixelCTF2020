##### The problem:

>so now you know where he lives, can you tell me what was written on his wall in 2013?
This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format, replace spaces with underscores ('_')
This is part of a series, more challenges will be unlocked once you solve this one. While most challenges will be OSINT, some of them may not be.



&nbsp;
##### The solution:
&nbsp;
Search the address you got from manhunt #7 in google streetview, in the top left corner you can select the period of streetview images you wish to see. If you select 2013 and move the view to the side-wall of the building you will see that there is 'Just Married' written on the wall.

**accepted flags = Just_Married / brixelCTF{Just_Married}**
