##### The problem:
&nbsp;
>Ah, now you know his name, good. Can you tell me his favorite food?
This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format
This is part of a series, more challenges will be unlocked once you solve this one. While most challenges will be OSINT, some of them may not be.




&nbsp;
##### The solution:
&nbsp;
Because we solved manhunt #1 we have the name Johnny Dorfmeister, if you look for this name on instagram you get his profile. The first image is of some burned macaroni (pasta), in the description of this image he states that macaroni is his favorite food.

**accepted flags = macaroni / brixelCTF{macaroni}**
