##### The problem:
&nbsp;
>Ah, now you know his name, good. Can you tell me the name of his last employer?
This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format
This is part of a series, more challenges will be unlocked once you solve this one. While most challenges will be OSINT, some of them may not be.



&nbsp;
##### The solution:
&nbsp;
Because we solved manhunt #1 we have the name Johnny Dorfmeister, if we google this name the first hit should be a linkedin profile. Here we see he worked from May 2011 to June 2011 as a webdeveloper for a company called pishapasha

This challenge unlocks manhunt #4,5,6 and 7

**accepted flags = pishapasha / brixelCTF{pishapasha}**
