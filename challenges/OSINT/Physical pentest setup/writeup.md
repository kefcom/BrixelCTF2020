##### The problem:
&nbsp;
>So we're going to try to install a 'bug' at the local police office of the city of Halen (BE)
The plan is to disguise ourselves as technicians of their telecom provider, but who is that?
This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format
Replace all spaces with underscores (_) while entering the flag!
‚ùó do NOT call them to get the information, you can find everything you need online! It's a criminal offence to bother them with nonsense like this and you could get in trouble for it. üìµ

##### The solution:
&nbsp;
The idea here is to figure out their public telephone number, and then find the provider for that number.
First we google "local police halen belgium", from there we get a portal page of the belgian police (police.be).
Here we can search again for Halen as a location, and it brings us to the information page of the local police station in Halen.
On this page there are 2 numbers, the 101 (global police number in belgium) and 011 938 938, this is the number we want: it's the landline number for the office.

Now we need to figure out who provides that number, this is a tricky search, but if you search for "find the provider of a phone number belgium" you will find the 'Common Reference Database Centre (CRDC)' website. 
This website is run by the Number Portability Association, a non-profit organisation assigned by the BIPT (the official postage and telecommunication institute in Belgium).
They are used to quickly find out what provider is responsible for a given number, so the portation of the number to a new provider can be done more quickly since the new operator knows who to contact for this number.
Anyway... if you lookup the number on this site, you will find out that COLT TELECOM is the provider for this number, remember: spaces have to be replaced with underscores, so the flag will be COLT_TELECOM

**accepted flags = COLT_TELECOM / brixelCTF{COLT_TELECOM}**
