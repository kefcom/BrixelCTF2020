##### The problem:
&nbsp;
>I heard this birdcall when walking the other day
Can you give me the LATIN name of this bird species?
Here's a dutch joke for you: Het is niet de proxi-musðŸ“±ðŸ¤£
replace (if any) spaces with underscores ('_')
This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format


&nbsp;
##### The solution:
&nbsp;
In this challenge you get a recording of a bird call, if you search online for "recognize birds from sounds" you get a few (paid) apps and also the website https://birdnet.cornell.edu/ On this website you can upload recordings and they will try to identify, for this recording there is only 1 result that is most likely to be our bird, it's the white storck (Ciconia_ciconia).

**accepted flags = Ciconia_ciconia / brixelCTF{Ciconia_ciconia}**
