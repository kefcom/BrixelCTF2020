##### The problem:
&nbsp;
>Ah, now you know his name, good. Can you tell me his birthday? (DD/MM/YYYY)
This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format
This is part of a series, more challenges will be unlocked once you solve this one. While most challenges will be OSINT, some of them may not be.





&nbsp;
##### The solution:
&nbsp;
Because we solved manhunt #1 we have the name Johnny Dorfmeister, Via linkedin we can see his twitter profile. On twitter you can share your birthday with followers, so you can see it when you follow johnny (I know this isn't really OPEN intelligence, but I tought it was fun so I kept it in).
If you follow Johnny on twitter you see his birthday: 18 December 1985, formatting it according to DD/MM/YYYY it's 18/12/1985

**accepted flags = 18/12/1985 / brixelCTF{18/12/1985}**
