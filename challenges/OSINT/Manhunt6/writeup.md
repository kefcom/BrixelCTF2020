##### The problem:
&nbsp;
>So he's a webdesigner huh? I wonder what his customers have to say about his work. In english please!
This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format
This is part of a series, more challenges will be unlocked once you solve this one. While most challenges will be OSINT, some of them may not be.

##### The solution:
&nbsp;
Because we solved manhunt #1 we have the name Johnny Dorfmeister, Via linkedin we can see his twitter profile. On twitter you find a message where he states he can't delete a page from his website, if you visit this website (howitshould.be) we see some testimonials in different languages, the last one is in russian and to throw you off there is a completely wrong 'translation' written below it. If you translate the russian text into english you get "There is a free flag: poetry"

This challenge unlocks manhunt #9

**accepted flags = poetry / brixelCTF{poetry}**
