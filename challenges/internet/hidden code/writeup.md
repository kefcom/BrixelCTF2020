### Challenge title: hidden code

##### The problem:
&nbsp;
>Something strange happens on the brixel website when you enter the konami code
flag = the character you see floating by
This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format

&nbsp;
##### The solution:
&nbsp;
First of all: what is the konami code: it's a cheatcode used in many konami games on consoles. It's a sequence of UP UP DOWN DOWN LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT B A START.
If you go to the brixel site and enter the code using the arrow keys, A and B it will show a running mario (also known as mario mario or super mario) on the screen.


**accepted flags = mario / mario mario / super mario / brixelCTF{mario} / brixelCTF{mario mario} / brixelCTF{super mario}**
