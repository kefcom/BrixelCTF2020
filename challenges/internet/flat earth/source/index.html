		<p>Ever since that Greek idiot Eratosthenes claimed that the earth is round, we have been living in a lie.</p>
		<p><img src="images/ATuin.jpg" alt="flat earth"></p>
		<p>The earth is not round! It is a flat disk set on top of a turtle travelling trough space!</p>
		<p>We believe that the government is actively trying to hide this great truth from us by sending us pictures from <b>their OWN</b> so called 'space administration' or 'nasa'</p>
		<p>Therefor we must unite against the government! Join our protests that are taking place all around the globe.</p>

		<p>Next protest:</p>
