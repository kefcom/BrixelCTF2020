##### The problem:
&nbsp;
>I found this cool website, it claims to be 100% robot-free!
There's nothing there yet at the moment, but at least it's robots-free. I wonder how they keep it that way?

##### The solution:
&nbsp;
Keeping robots out is done by using a robots.txt file, so if you go to the website and add robots.txt you will find the flag: http://timesink.be/robotopia/robots.txt
***#you found a flag! it is: brixelCTF{sadr0b0tz}***
