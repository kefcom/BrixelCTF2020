##### The problem:
&nbsp;
>My buddy is trying to become a web developer, he made this little login page. Can you get the password?
http://timesink.be/login1/index.html



&nbsp;
##### The solution:
&nbsp;
Check the source of the page. There is a javascript function that checks if the value of element 'the_password' equals brixelCTF{w0r5t_j4v45cr1pt_3v3r!}
**accepted flags = brixelCTF{w0r5t_j4v45cr1pt_3v3r!}**
