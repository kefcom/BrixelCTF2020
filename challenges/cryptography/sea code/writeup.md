##### The problem:
&nbsp;
>beep beep beeeep...
This one should be fairly straight forward
This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format

&nbsp;
##### The solution:
&nbsp;
This should sound familiar to most people as being morse code.
For this demonstration I used an online tool to translate it: https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html
When you upload the .wav file it will resolve it to: ***THE FLAG FOR THIS CHALLENGE IS SEAGULL***

**accepted flags = SEAGULL / brixelCTF{SEAGULL}**
