##### The problem:
&nbsp;
>A french messenger was caught during the war
He was carrying a piece of paper that read: Vvr ktdk vl jvtzsyHBI{fnzcievs}
Upon torturing the messenger for an explaination, he only shouted 'confidentiel'!!!
Too bad he died, I bet something good was in that message :(

&nbsp;
##### The solution:
&nbsp;
There are quite a few hints given in the description here:
* It's encryption (since it's in the crypto category)
* It's french from origin
* We have the encrypted text bearing the distinct 'brixelCTF{}' format near the end
* We know the messenger shouted 'confidentiel' over and over again

When we search for encryption methods that are french in origin, we find the 'vineg√®re cipher'.
This type of cipher is actually a series of interwoven ceasar ciphers using a [tabula recta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_recta).
It all boils down to this: you need a 'password' that can be used to decrypt te message. hmm... what was that word he shouted?
To decrypt this message I used https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher .
Enter the encrypted text, select the 'Knowing the Key/Password' option and use 'confidentiel' as the key. Press the decrypt button.
On the left you will find the result: **The flag is brixelCTF{baguette}**

**accepted flags = brixelCTF{baguette}**
